# RAAPL

Educational implementation of relational algebra in APL.

I've only implemented the `project` operator so far. More soon.

**NB:** `Operator` is used in the relational algebra sense, not the APL sense!

Now has some simple unit tests.

Run (or look at) `test_relation_creation`, `test_relation_can_insert_data`!
